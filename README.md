👋 Hi, I’m @JonStrutt27!
I'm currently enrolled in an intensive 2 year program at kood/sisu to become a full-stack developer. Having worked in the SaaS industry on the business side for the past 8 years, I finally decided to shift gears and move over to the fun side of Saas. I started school in Jan 2025 and plan to graduate end of 2027.

Some of the projects I've completed:
- A mock forum project using Go & Sqlite3
- A pathfinding algorithm project
- ASCII art encoder/decoder

Interests
- Database management
- Backend development
- General data structures and algorithms
- Diving into new rabbit holes like Linux (currently using Mint), Raspberry Pi, and code editors (like Vim)

Languages
- Golang
- JavaScript
- TypeScript
